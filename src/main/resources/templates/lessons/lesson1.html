            <h5 class="card-title">What is Cryptocurrency?</h5>
            <p class="card-text ">Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography (the process of converting legible information into an uncrackable code) for security and operates independently of a central bank. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized technology to allow users to make secure payments and store money without the need for traditional financial intermediaries such as banks.</p>

            <p class="dark m-3 p-3">Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, but there are now thousands of other cryptocurrencies in circulation, including Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and many more. Cryptocurrencies are usually built on blockchain technology, a distributed ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent manner.</p>

            <p class="p-3">Cryptocurrencies are often seen as an alternative to traditional currencies and have been gaining popularity in recent years due to their decentralized nature, low transaction fees, and potential for high returns on investment. However, they also come with their own set of risks and challenges, including volatility, security concerns, and regulatory uncertainty.</p>

            <p class="p-3">Cryptocurrency is designed to be decentralized, which means that there is no single entity or organization that ensures its fairness. Instead, cryptocurrency networks rely on a system of consensus algorithms to validate transactions and maintain the integrity of the network.</p>

            <h4 class="p-3">"What is a crypto 'Coin' or 'Token'?"</h4>
            <p class="p-3">While the terms "coin" and "token" are often used interchangeably, they refer to two different types of digital assets in the cryptocurrency space.<br>the key difference between coins and tokens is that coins operate on their own independent blockchain network, while tokens are built on top of an existing blockchain network and use its infrastructure to operate.</p>

            <h4 class="p-3">Coins</h4>
            <p class="p-3">A Coin is a digital asset that operates on its own blockchain and has its own independent network. Coins are used as a means of payment, store of value, or a medium of exchange. Examples of coins include Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).</p>
            <h4 class="p-3">Tokens</h4>
<p class="p-3">On the other hand, a token is a digital asset that operates on top of an existing blockchain network, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or others. Tokens are created using smart contracts and can represent a variety of assets, including digital assets, real-world assets, or other types of value. Tokens can be used for a variety of purposes, such as access to a platform or service, incentivizing users, or representing a share in a project. Examples of tokens include ERC-20 tokens, such as Basic Attention Token (BAT) or Chainlink (LINK).</p>
